to the ALICE Analysis Tutorial documentation\n\nThis is a community-contributed place where we collect all our documentation. Every ALICE member can\ncontribute, and the Analysis Tutorial Committee will review every contribution.\nWhere can I see the documentation online?\nDocumentation is published on GitHub pages at the following address:\n\nhttps://alice-doc.github.io/alice-analysis-tutorial/\n\nHow can I contribute to the documentation?\nFirst off you need a GitHub account. Fork the\nalice-doc/alice-analysis-tutorial repository, then clone it to your\nlaptop:\ngit clone https://github.com/alice-doc/alice-analysis-tutorial\ncd alice-analysis-tutorial/\ngit remote add  https://github.com//alice-analysis-tutorial\n\nDocumentation is written in Markdown and it\nis generated using GitBook. You need to install GitBook first. GitBook\nis a NodeJS package, meaning that you need npm to install it. You can get npm easily.\nOn Ubuntu:\nsudo apt install npm\n\nOn macOS (assuming you have Homebrew:\nbrew install npm\n\nOn CentOS 7 (you need EPEL enabled):\nsudo yum install npm\n\nOnce npm is installed, you can install GitBook:\nsudo npm install -g gitbook-cli\n\nDo not use sudo on macOS.\nOnce GitBook is installed, you should find it in your $PATH, check it with:\ntype gitbook\n\nTo preview the documentation pages locally while you are editing them, move to the repository's root\ndirectory and run:\ncd alice-analysis-tutorial/\nmake serve\n\nThe command will not exit and a local website will be visible at the following address:\n\nhttp://localhost:4000\n\nThe website uses GitBook. Editing the pages using your favorite text\neditor: whenever you save, the page currently opened in your local preview will be refreshed\nautomatically.\nWhen you are happy with your modifications, commit them, push them to your repository and open a\npull request, for instance:\ngit commit -a -m 'I am happy with my doc'\ngit push \n\nthen navigate to your GitHub repository online to open a pull request.\n"},"analysis/":{"url":"analysis/","title":"Analysis Tutorial","keywords":"","body":"Writing a mini-analysis\nIn the following exercises, you will write a very small, but realistic, data analysis from the grounds up. The starting point is a minimal task that fills a histogram with a transverse momentum distribution. This task has already been written for you. As you go along, you will add code to this task, so that in the end, you can run a mini-analysis measuring the centrality dependence of charged pions production at mid-rapidity. \nThe exercises were originally used to accompany a set of lectures that you can find here, (check the Thursday). However, you can be followed without having attended the lecture. \nTo access ALICE data and run the analysis on the Grid, you will need to be an ALICE member (a CERN lightweight account does not suffice). When in doubt about this, ask your supervisor.  \n"},"analysis/setup.html":{"url":"analysis/setup.html","title":"Step 1 - Setup the tutorial","keywords":"","body":"Obtain your source code\nThe starting point for these exercises is the analysis template called AliAnalysisTaskMyTask. To obtain the source code of this analysis, choose one of the following two options: \n\nClone the Git repository. Programmers use version control systems when developing their code. You will also use version control (in our case through Git) when you are contributing to the ALICE code base. So why not start with Git right now? You can clone the example task repository, which you can find it on here, by typing, in a terminal\ngit clone git@github.com:rbertens/ALICE_analysis_tutorial.git\nThis will clone the remote repository, so that you have access to a carbon copy of the full repository on your local computer. \n\nA more robust approach to working with Git, is creating a remote fork of a certain repository, and working on this fork. For this, you will need to open a GitHub [https://github.com/] account (which you will need in any case if you want to contribute to ALICE software). If you have a GitHub account, you create a fork of the example task repository by surfing here and clicking on fork at the top right of the screen. If you have forked the repository, you can proceed to cloning it on your laptop in the way as explained in option 1; this then allows you to develop the code, and push commits to your own fork\n\n\nWhichever approach you chose, the end result should be that you have stored these files on your laptop. One word of caution:  the path in which you store these files cannot contain spaces! E.g. /home/my  task/ will not work, use /home/my_task/  .\nA first look at your task\nAs a start, just take a look at code that makes up the task:\n\nAliAnalysisTaskMyTask.cxx\n\nAliAnalysisTaskMyTask.h\n\nAddMyTask.C\n\nrunAnalysis.C\n\n\nYou will see that the code is extensively documented. Can you tell\n\nwhich function is called for each event?\n\nwhere are the output histogram defined?\n\nwhere are the output histogram filled?\n\n\nRemember, that for now, the name ‘AliAnalysisTaskMyTask’ doesn’t sound so bad, but when you develop a task ‘in real life’, make sure to give it a meaningful name, that explains what the task is aimed at.\nObtain input data\nTo run your own analysis task, you will also need to download a file that contains reconstructed collisions. This input file is called AliAOD.root, short for Analysis Object Data. In the following steps, will assume that we are looking at Pb-Pb data that was taken in 2015. You can also choose to run on data from a different period or collision system.  \nSource your environment\nWe will get the data form the ALICE file catalogue. To access the file catalogue, you will need to use AliEn-Runtime and have a valid Grid certificate. This means that, at this point, we will assume that you have built all the ALICE software (see our build manual for that ).\nLoad your ALICE environment as explained here, e.g. by doing\nalienv enter AliPhysics::latest\nYou should see which module files are currently loaded, e.g.\n  1) BASE/1.0\n  2) GCC-Toolchain/v6.2.0-alice1-1\n  3) AliEn-Runtime/v2-19-le-1\n  4) GSL/v1.16-1\n  5) Python-modules/1.0-1\n  6) ROOT/v6-10-06+git_c54db1c10b-1\n  7) boost/v1.59.0-1\n  8) cgal/v4.6.3-1\n  9) fastjet/v3.2.1_1.024-alice1-1\n 10) Vc/1.3.2-1\n 11) AliRoot/0742e9dc6e12c74634a1e353ab00ceba45335401_ROOT6-1\n 12) AliPhysics/latest\nUse alienv list to list loaded modules.

This is step one towards becoming a professional physicist (no turning back from here ... ) If it didn’t work, ask for help. Also this is a very significant part of becoming a physicist ...\nAt this point, it’s time to expand our task a bit. What we will do is\n\nAdd some event selection criteria\n\nAdd some track selection criteria\n\n\nBut let’s not go too fast.\nThe event loop\nCollisions are referred to as ‘events’. In our analysis task, the function \nAliAnalysisTaskSE::UserExec\nis called once for each event in the input data set. You never have to explicitly call this function yourself ! Remember, from programming 101 classes, the lecture about inheritance in C++? The UserExec function is called by a base class that you do not have to worry about. We will later see that this function is only called when an event passes your trigger selection. \nFun !\nIt’s time to add some code to our task. First, create additional output histograms in which you’ll store\n\nThe primary vertex positions along the beam line for all events\n\nJust like the example histogram fHistPt, you have to add these histograms as members of your class. So: create the pointers in the header file, remember to initialize the pointers in your class constructors, and don’t forget to create instances of the histograms in the UserCreateOutput method.\nOne of the trickiest things in programming can be finding out what methods to use out of millions of lines of code. To help you out, here's a line of code to obtain the vertex position along the beam line\nfloat vertexZ = fAOD->GetPrimaryVertex()->GetZ();\n\nYou can of course just copy-paste these lines into your task and hope that it works, but try to think of\n\ndo you understand the logic of these lines?\n\ncan you find out in which classes these methods are defined?\n\n\nTry to run the code again, after you’ve added these histograms.\nAll set?\nIt’s almost time to run the modified analysis. Not all collisions in the detector are actually usable for physics analysis. Events which happen very far from the center of the detector, for example, are usually not used for analysis (any idea why?). To make sure that we only look at high quality data, we do ’event selection’. Let’s add some event selection criteria to your task.\n\nModify the code such that only primary vertices are accepted within 10 cm of detector center. Such selections in the event sample or track sample are usually referred to as ‘cuts’. \nGenerally, we want to see how much data we ‘throw away’ when applying a cut. How would you go about doing that?\n\nBesides rejecting data via cuts, we also make data selection while data taking, by ‘triggering’: selecting collisions in which we expect certain processes to have occurred. You can check which triggers are selected in the AddMyTask.C macro , where we call\n    task->SelectCollisionCandidates(AliVEvent::kAnyINT);\nAs you can see, trigger classes are defined in the class AliVEvent.

An IDE might help you with that. \nTrack selection\nJust as some events are not of fit to do analysis with, some tracks are also not good for looking at certain observables. In addition to ’event cuts’, we therefore have to apply ’track cuts’ as well. In ALICE, we usually use a system of predefined track selection criteria, that are checked by reading the filterbit of a track. \n\nCheck in the code where the filterbit selection is done\n\nChange the filterbit selection from value 1 to 128 to 512\n\n\nHow does your eta, phi distribution change, if you run your task again with filterbit 512? What do you think is the cause of the difference? Keep in mind for later, that you will have to choose your filterbit selection wisely, different types of analyses need different track selections. Discuss with your colleagues, working group or supervisor to decide on what would be best for your analysis. \nTIP\n\nIf you ran your task again, you have - most likely - overwritten the output of the previous run, which makes it hard to compare the distributions obtained with the different filterbits - it can be useful to keep all output files you generate on a safe place on your hard drive\n\n... if you keep the files make sure that you will remember which event and track selections you used. In a few weeks, you have probably forgotten which filterbit was set for a certain output file.

Some specific technical information on how to implement this in your task is given at the end of this document, but general steps to follow are explained here. First, the goals. What we want to do is\n\nidentify pions\n\ncheck how ’pure’ our pion sample is\n\n\nWe’ll do this by looking at the TPC signal, and seeing how well this signal corresponds to the expected signal for a certain particle species. Look at the figure for clarification, you see lines (the expected signal a particle leaves in the TPC, ‘the hypothesis’) and in colors, the actual signals that were deposited.\nStart by storing the TPC signals for all charged particles in your events, in a two-dimensional histogram (such as shown in the figure). First follow the ’technical steps’ from Sec. 8, and then try to make such a plot.\nHint, you can get this information by doing\nfYour2DHistogram->Fill(track->P(), track->GetTPCsignal());\n\nIf your histogram is empty after running, try using Filterbit 1 rather than 128.\nAs a second step, you identify particles, and store only the TPC signal that corresponds to pions. \nBEFORE YOU START ...\nTo speed things up a bit, the code that you will need for this exercise is given and explained here. It is recommended to read the entire section prior to implementing the methods.  \nTo identify particles, you will add an additional task to your analysis, the ‘PID response’ task. This task makes sure that parametrizations that we use for e.g. specific energy loss in the TPC are loaded. To add this task to your analysis, open your runAnalysis.C macro, and add the following lines. Make sure that these lines are called before your own task is added to that analysis manager, your task will depend on this task:\n// load the macro and add the task\nTMacro PIDadd(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_ROOT/ANALYSIS/macros/AddTaskPIDResponse.C\"));\nAliAnalysisTaskPIDResponse* PIDresponseTask = reinterpret_cast(PIDadd.Exec());\n\nthe above code snippet will work under ROOT6. If you are running ROOT5, the lines to use are a bit different:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"$ALICE_ROOT/ANALYSIS/macros/AddTaskPIDResponse.C\");\nAddTaskPIDResponse();\n\nAs a second step, you’ll have to make some changed to the header of our analysis. First, you’ll add another class member, which is a pointer to the AliPIDresponse object that we’ll use in our class. To do this, remember how you added pointers to histograms earlier in this tutorial, so add\n\na forward declaration of the type, i.e. ‘class AliPIDResponse’\n\nthe pointer itself, i.e. ‘AliPIDResponse* fPIDResponse; //! pid response object’\n\n\nDon’t forget to add this new pointer fPIDResponse to the member initialization list in your class constructors (in the .cxx files)!\nAfter making changes to the header, you can add the actual identification routine. This will be done in the implementation of the class. You need to go through a few steps:\n\nRetrieve the AliPIDResponse object from the analysis manager;\n\nmake our poiter ‘fPIDResponse’ point to the AliPIDResponse object;\n\ninclude the header for the AliPIDResponse class, so that the compiler knows how it is defined\n\n\nThe code to do this might be a bit difficult to figure out by yourself, so it’s given here below\nAliAnalysisManager *man = AliAnalysisManager::GetAnalysisManager();\nif (man) {\n    AliInputEventHandler* inputHandler = (AliInputEventHandler*)(man->GetInputEventHandler());\n    if (inputHandler)   fPIDResponse = inputHandler->GetPIDResponse();\n}\n\nDo you understand\n\nwhat happens in each line?\n\nin which function (UserCreateOutputObjects, UserExcec, Terminate, etc) to put this code?\n\n\nNow that we’ve retrieved our PID response object, it’s time to use it. To extract information for different particle species, you can use the functions\ndouble kaonSignal = fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kKaon);\ndouble pionSignal = fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kPion);\ndouble protonSignal = fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kProton);\n\nWhat these functions return you, is a probability that a particle is of a certain type, expressed in standard deviations (σ\\sigmaσ) . To identify a particle, we’ll require that its PIDresponse signal lies withim 3 standard deviations of the expected signal. To check this, you can write a few lines such as\nif (std::abs(fPIDResponse->NumberOfSigmasTPC(track, AliPID::kPion)) \nPutting what you have read in practice\nUse the code snippets given in the above sections to implement your particle identification routines. If you are confident that can ’isolate’ the pions, create new histograms to store the pion’s\n\ntransverse momentum\n\npseudorapidity\n\nazimuthal angle\n\n\nCentrality\nMost heavy-ion analyses report their results in intervals of collision centrality. In order to access collision centrality within your analysis, you will have to add yet another task to the chain of tasks that is called in your run macro. This third task also needs to be executed prior your own task (note, that the procedure for obtaining centrality for run 1 data can be different - when in doubt, ask your supervisor). The task, called AliMultSelectionTask, can be added to the manager using the following instructions:\n    TMacro multSelection(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/COMMON/MULTIPLICITY/macros/AddTaskMultSelection.C\"));\n    AliMultSelectionTask* multSelectionTask = reinterpret_cast(multSelection.Exec());\n\nor, using the ROOT5 equivalent\n    gROOT->LoadMacro(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/COMMON/MULTIPLICITY/macros/AddTaskMultSelection.C\");\n    AliMultSelectionTask* multSelectionTask = AddTaskMultSelection(kFALSE);\n\nTo access centrality within your analysis task, you need to obtain a pointer to the AliMultSelection object, and obtain the collision centrality through this object, e.g. by doing\n    Float_t centrality(0);\n    AliMultSelection *multSelection =static_cast(fAOD->FindListObject(\"MultSelection\"));\n    if(multSelection) centrality = multSelection->GetMultiplicityPercentile(\"V0M\");\n\nUsing the above code snippets, can you select pions in 0-10% centrality, and 50-60% centrality? Does the number of pions change in the way you would expect them to change ?\n"},"analysis/grid.html":{"url":"analysis/grid.html","title":"Step 6 -Run your code on GRID","keywords":"","body":"Step 6\nIs your pion analysis running smoothly on your laptop?

It is generated daily.\n"},"analysis/ROOT5-to-6.html":{"url":"analysis/ROOT5-to-6.html","title":"Transition from ROOT5 to ROOT6","keywords":"","body":"Transition from ROOT5 to ROOT6\nROOT6 is similar to ROOT5: It comes with the same library of classes (base\nclasses, histogram classes like TH1, ...) which share the same interface as under\nROOT5. It provides a command line interface as ROOT5, and runs macros just\nlike under ROOT5. Therefore it is possible to build and run the ALICE\nsimulation, reconstruction and analysis framework under ROOT6. AliPhysics can be\nbuilt against ROOT6 in the following way:\naliBuild -z --defaults root6 build AliPhysics\n\nFor classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics this transition is transparent. For code in\nmacros there are however a few difference. This page tries to summarize the\ndifferences in behaviour observed so far and gives some suggestions how to solve\nthese issues so work can go on smoothly under ROOT6.\nWhat is a just-in-time compiler?\nFor the command line interface and running macros ROOT5 uses CINT, which is an\ninterpreter for C/C++. An interpreter processes a macro line-by-line. It depends\non the implementation of the interpreter how C++ code will be handled and how\nclose the interpretation comes to the language standard. ROOT5 allows for some\ndeviations from the language standards, which means that some coding errors\nwhich would thrown by a compiler leading in a break of the compilation are still\ntolerated by ROOT5. Furthermore the standard library is not fully supported as\nits handling has to be implemented into the compiler. Macro can however also be\nrun in the compiled mode by ROOT5 (adding a \"+\" to the macro name). In this case\nROOT calls an external compiler to compile the macro to a library which is loaded\ninto ROOT. Once the macro runs in compiled mode it is expected to be fully\ncompatible with the C++ standard and coding error free as the compiler will not\ntolerate compiler errors.\nIn contrast to this ROOT6 uses a just-in-time compiler called cling. A\njust-in-time compiler translates each statement, no matter whether it is a single\ncommand or a complicated macro, into machine code as it would be a program and\nonly afterwards runs this piece of code. In order to translate code into machine\ncode the compiler must know how to translate every single line. Based on powerful\ncompiler library this means for ROOT6 that all macro must comply to 100% with\nthe C++ language standard, and exceptions will not be tolerated. Furthermore this\nalso means that all symbols and objects must be known at compile time. This has\nthree side effects:\n\nLoading Functions with gROOT->LoadMacro(...);: This function loads all\nfunctions it finds within the macro into ROOT during run time. For an interpreter\nthis is sufficient as the functions are used after they are loaded. However the\ncompiler must know all symbols used in a macro at compile time.\nLoading libraries with gSystem->Load(...);: Here we have the same problem:\nThe symbols in the libraries must be known before they are used.\nCompiling ALICE analysis tasks on the fly with gROOT->LoadMacro(\"...+\");:\nAs the analysis task compiled like this will be converted in a library it must be\nknow to the just-in-time compiler before.\n\nFor all three cases exist workarounds which will be discussed in the next\nsections. In general macros which were running under ROOT5 in the compiled mode\nwill also run under ROOT6. Macros which were running only in the interpreted\nmode might contain coding errors which were not handled by ROOT5 and might\ntherefore need fixes. However the just-in-time compiler will give precise error\nmessages leading exactly to the lines which need fixes.\nHow can I call macros inside macros?\nCalling macros inside macros is a bit tricky as the result of a macro will be\navailable only at runtime. There are however several workarounds which cover the \nmost common use cases:\n\nUsing ROOT's TMacro:\nTMacro is a wrapper class around the macro processing. It is constructed with\nthe macro path. The macro is run using TMacro::Exec. The result of\nTMacro::Exec() is a number representing an address in memory where to\nfind the resulting object. This has to be cast into a pointer to an object of\nthe expected type. Example:\nTMacro physseladd(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"));\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(physseladd.Exec());\n\nThe macro is still evaluated at runtime, however with the reinterpret_cast to\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask * we tell ROOT that the result of the macro\ninterpretation must be of type AliPhysicsSelectionTask *, so the type is known\nat compile time. TMacro::Exec optionally gets a string representation of the\nfunction arguments. This might be a bit complicated to handle, particularly if\nthe arguments are dynamic and change at run time. The method works both for\nROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nUsing gROOT/gInterpreter->ProcessLine: \nMacro execution can be launched as well via gROOT->ProcessLine() /\ngInterpreter->ProcessLine(). As with TMacro this method is focused on running\na macro and not loading content from it. The ProcessLine method returns a\nlong number representing an address in memory where to find the output objects.\nThis number has to be cast to the expected output type using a\nreinterpret_cast in order to access the content of the output objects. The\nfollowing example runs the add macro for the physics selection task:\nAliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(gInterpreter->ProcessLine(Form(\".x %s\", gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"))))\n\nAdding function arguments is possible here as well as a simple string\nrepresentation after the macro path, surrounded with (). This method also works\nboth under ROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nIncluding macros:\nAs ROOT6 compiles the macro it is possible to include macros and treat them\nas if they were header files. In order for this to work it is essential to tell\nROOT before where to find the macro. This can be done using the preprocessor\nmacro R_ADD_INCLUDE_PATH(...). For the just-in-time compiler macros\nincluded will look as if they were part of the code itself. The following macro\nruns under ROOT6:\n#ifdef __CLING__\n// Tell  ROOT where to find AliRoot headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_ROOT)\n#include \n\n// Tell ROOT where to find AliPhysics headers\nR__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_PHYSICS)\n#include \n#endif\n\nvoid simpleaddtest(){\n  AliAnalysisManager *mgr = new AliAnalysisManager;\n\n  // Take function from macro AddESDHandler\n  // no gROOT->LoadMacro for ROOT6\n  AddESDHandler();\n\n  AliPhysicsSelectionTask *test = AddTaskPhysicsSelection(kTRUE);\n\n  mgr->InitAnalysis();\n  mgr->PrintStatus();\n}\n\nIn particular when passing arguments to the macro (in the example above passing\nkTRUE to AddTaskPhysicsSelection) this method is very convenient. This method\nis specific to ROOT6. The part including macros has to be protected (see\nbelow).\n\n\nDo I need to include header files in my macros?\nROOT6 comes with a technique called pre-compiled header files. Header files\nfrom a certain library are compiled to a binary format by rootcling, the\nsuccessor of rootcint, and loaded into ROOT6 by an auto-loading mechanism\nsimilar to the rootmap mechanism. Once rootcling is invoked with the\nargument -rml name a .pcm-file is created containing the pre-compiled\nheaders. ROOT6 will search for .pcm-files in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nThe following packages in ALICE provide .pcm support:\n\nAliRoot\nAliPhysics\nRooUnfold\nFairRoot\no2\n\nFor libraries providing .pcm-support NO headers should be included in macros.\nFor libraries handled by the user make sure to\n\nrun rootcling with the arguments -rmf for the .rootmap file\nand -rml for the .pcm file\nInstall both the .rootmap and the .pcm file of your library path in the \nlibrary location (usually PROJECT_PATH/lib)\n\nI get a huge amount of errors, and my macro doesn't run. What can I do?\nHere are few examples that commonly appear in user macros and which are tolerated by ROOT5 but not anymore by ROOT6:\n\nUndefined symbols:\nMaybe you have something like this in your code:\ntaskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThe variable taskname was not defined before. It was implicitly defined in ROOT5 as const char *. In ROOT6 this leads to the error\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'taskname'\nThe variable taskname must be defined with a type before a value can be assigned. In this case the proper code would be\nconst char *taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThanks to C++11 ROOT6 can also detect the type implicitly using the keyword\nauto. In this case the code looks the following:\nauto taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThis will however not be transparent to ROOT5 as ROOT5 doesn't understand\nC++11.\nNote: On the command line ROOT6 automatically adds the auto keyword. The \nstatement above will be possible in the interpreted mode of ROOT6.\n\nMissing forward declarations\nConsider this macro:\nvoid fail_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nUnder ROOT5 this macro will run, but under ROOT6 it will raise the following compiler error:\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'test'\nThe function test is defined, but after it is used. In ROOT5 this is\nno problem: During interpretation the interpreter loads all functions. But\nunder ROOT6 the macro is compiled, and now the order matters: Functions need\nto be declared before they are used. Adding a forward declaration is \nsufficient in order to make the macro working. The following version of\nthe macro will run also under ROOT6:\nint test(int a, int b);\n\nvoid run_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nHandling of pointer and objects:\nROOT5 does not enforce using the proper access operator for objects, pointers and\nreferences, but will allow the usage of the operator -> for\nreferences and the operator . for pointers. ROOT6 distinguishes\nbetween them, and consequently the proper access operator needs to be used.\nConsider the following macro:\nvoid fail_access(){\n  TH1F *ptr = new TH1F(\"ptr\", \"ptr\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  ptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n\n  TH1F obj(\"obj\", \"obj\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj.GetTitle());\n}\n\nConsequently the wrong access operator is used. ROOT5 will warn about the\nincorrect access operator, but it will run the macro. Trying this under ROOT6\nends in the following errors:\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\nptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  ~~~^\n     ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^\n                             ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  ~~~^~\n     .\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj->GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^~\n                             .\n\n\nI get a huge amount of unknown symbols from classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics? Do I still need to include header files?\nIn case the compilation of a macro under ROOT6 fails libraries and pre-compiled\nheaders from external packages are not loaded. The consequence is that ROOT6\ndoes not know about these classes and will raise errors about unknown symbols.\nOnce all the initial compiler errors are fixed (usually at the very top of\nthe error log), the next time the macros are compiled ROOT6 will also load the\nlibraries and .pch files from external libraries and the errors disappear. Header\nfrom ALICE libraries should NOT be included.\nHow do I distinguish between ROOT5 and ROOT6 in my macros?\nSometimes macros require different treatment for ROOT5 and ROOT6. It is then\nnecessary to know which ROOT version is used while the macro is running.\nROOT5 defines the preprocessor macro __CINT__, which can be used to check\nwhether one is in an interpreter session. In current (up to at least v6-12-04)\nhowever also ROOT6 exports __CINT__, so this macro cannot be used to\ndistinguish between ROOT versions.\nROOT6 in addition __CLING__ which is not present in ROOT5. The following lines \nindicate how to run ROOT5/ROOT6 specific code:\n#if defined(__CLING__)\n  // ROOT6-specific code here ...\n#elif defined(__CINT__)\n  // ROOT5-specific code here ...\n#endif\n\nI heard TF1 has changed fundamentally. Is there something to be aware of?\nTF1 is based on TFormula for the formula representation. TFormula got a heavy\nchange: In ROOT5 formulas were always interpreted on-the-fly. With ROOT6 they\nare compiled by the just-in-time compiler. While this leads to a significant\nspeedup in particular when the formula is evaluated multiple times (in fit\nprocedures for example) it comes on cost of breaking backward compatibility, for\nwhich reading TFormula/TF1 object created with ROOT6 with ROOT5 will lead to\nerrors. For what concerns TFormala a ROOT5-compatible version has been added to\nROOT6 as ROOT::v5::TFormula, however something similar does not exist for\nTF1. In order to read a TF1 object from a ROOT file under ROOT5 it has to be\ncreated under ROOT5.\nNow my macro finally works under ROOT6. Will it still work under ROOT5?\nIt depends whether the macro now contains something which ROOT5 does NOT\nunderstand.\n\nROOT6 is fully compatible with C++11. In ROOT5 C++11 support is not\nimplemented, but the standard C++98 is used. C++11-specific code will not\nbe understood.\nAll NEW features provided by ROOT6 are of course not ported to ROOT5.\nThis in particular affects:\nTTreeReader\nTProcPool\nTDataFrame\n...\n\n\nStandard library support in ROOT5, while it comes out-if-the-box in ROOT6.\nIf the macro should run under both ROOT versions consider ROOT containers\ninstead.\nIf your classes write stl-containers containing ROOT-objects to a ROOT-file \nthey must be declared to ROOT5 in your LinkDef.h file. Example:#pragma link C++ class std::vector+;\n\nFor ROOT6 this is not necessary.\n\n\n\n"},"building/":{"url":"building/","title":"Building ALICE software","keywords":"","body":"How to build ALICE software\nThe ALICE experiment currently has two frameworks:\n\nAliRoot/AliPhysics for\nLHC Run 1 and Run 2\nO2, currently under development, for Run 3 software\n\nBuilding software has become an increasingly complicated operation, as our software has many\ndependencies and we expect it to work both on your laptop and on the Grid.

The directory\n~/alice/sw will be created the first time you run aliBuild.\n\nNote that this directory tends to grow in size over time, and it is the one you need to remove in\ncase of cleanups.\n\nI don't have root permissions\nIn case you don't have root permissions, the most general way of installing aliBuild is to specify\na user directory where to install it. Start with opening your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile (this\ndepends on your system), and add the following lines:\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=\"$HOME/user_python\"\nexport PATH=\"$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\"\n\nNow close all your terminals and reopen them to load the new configuration. Check if it works by\nprinting the variable:\necho $PYTHONUSERBASE\n\nThe operations above need to be performed only once. Now, to install or upgrade aliBuild, just do:\npip install alibuild --upgrade --user\n\n\nThis time we did not specify sudo and we have added the --user option. The Python variable\nPYTHONUSERBASE tells pip where to install the package.\n\nVerify you have aliBuild in your path:\ntype aliBuild\n\nI want a special version of aliBuild\nIn some cases you might want to install a \"release candidate\" version, or you want to get the code\ndirectly from GitHub.

You want, however, to be able to see and control the source\ncode for the components you are developing: in our example we will show how to do that for AliRoot,\nAliPhysics and (if you also develop Run 3 software) O2.\nInitialize or update your work area\nWe will assume our work area is ~/alice. Let's create it and download the source of the packages\nwe need to develop.\nmkdir ~/alice\ncd ~/alice\n\nFor Run 2 software:\naliBuild init AliRoot,AliPhysics\n\nFor Run 3 software (you can have both Run 2 and Run 3 source code under the same directory):\naliBuild init O2 --defaults o2\n\n\nDo not forget the --defaults o2, aliBuild will complain if you don't specify it.\n\nThe commands above will finish with a message like:\n==> Development directory . created for aliroot, aliphysics\nIf you do ls, you will see the AliRoot, AliPhysics and O2 directories, plus an additional alidist\ndirectory: this is the place containing the software recipes, telling aliBuild how to construct our\nsoftware, and you can ignore it.\n Software and recipes must be updated manually!aliBuild init downloads software, and the recipes directory, for you the first time, but then they\nwill behave like any other Git directory and aliBuild will never update them any longer. You will\nneed to take care of the update yourself.\nThis means, in most cases, moving into the software directory and doing something like:\ngit checkout master\ngit reset --hard origin/master\ngit pull\n\nNote that the operation above differs for O2 (where the default branch is dev, not master), and\nthe git reset --hard command is destructive: it will align your repository to the upstream one by\nmaking you lose all your local changes.\nIf you want to checkout a specific version of the software, you have again to bear in mind that\nAliRoot, AliPhysics and O2 are normal Git repositories. Do something like:\n( cd AliRoot && git checkout v5-09-11 )\n( cd AliPhysics && git checkout v5-09-11-01 )\n\ninstead of using master and pulling from there.\n\nCheck your prerequisites\naliBuild comes with the command aliDoctor that will help you identifying if your prerequisites\nwere installed correctly. In general, aliBuild is capable of building all required software\ndependencies, but it has also the ability to take them \"from the system\" if possible, resulting in\nless time spent for building for you.\nRun the aliDoctor command to check dependencies for Run 2 software:\ncd ~/alice\naliDoctor AliPhysics\n\nFor Run 2 software based on ROOT 6 (note: this is the only option on macOS):\ncd ~/alice\naliDoctor AliPhysics --defaults root6\n\nFor Run 3 software:\ncd ~/alice\naliDoctor O2 --defaults o2\n\naliDoctor will warn you that some packages have to be built as they could not be found from the\nsystem. If you have followed the instructions, this list should contain nothing more than:\n\nboost\nCMake\nGSL\nnanomsg\nprotobuf\nVc\nyaml-cpp\nZeroMQ\nSWIG\n\nIn particular, you should never have Python or Python-modules. If the output is longer than this\nlist, please go through the prerequisites once again and run aliDoctor again. If the output\ncontains those packages, or less packages, then you are fine and you may continue.\n\nIf you think a package is shown but should not be in the list because you are sure you have\ninstalled it, it might just be that its version it's incompatible (this frequently happens with\nCMake) or you are missing the \"development\" package for that component.\n\nBuild and rebuild\nIf you have followed the prerequisites part thoroughly, and if you have double-checked it with\naliDoctor, it's time to run your build.\nRemember that you have checked out manually the sources for AliRoot, AliPhysics and O2, so before\nbuilding make sure your sources are up to date by following the instructions above.\nThere are different ways of building Run 2 software depending on your configuration and your\ndesired features. The build command is:\ncd ~/alice\naliBuild build AliPhysics [--defaults DEFAULTS]\n\nChoose your --defaults accordingly:\n\n\n\nDefaults\nROOT 6\nGEANT3, 4, DPMJET\nWorks on macOS\n\n\n\n\n\nno\nyes\nno\n\n\nuser\nno\nno (faster)\nno\n\n\nroot6\nyes\nyes\nyes\n\n\nuser-root6\nyes\nno (faster)\nyes\n\n\n\nNote that it is mandatory to use ROOT 6 on macOS. ROOT 5 builds do not work there. In most cases\nthe user (and user-root6) installation is sufficient and takes less time and disk space.\nYou will need to run the exact same command when rebuilding, with the same --defaults option.\n Build with ROOT 5 and 6 at the same timeIf you want to build, using the same source, against ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 at the same time, you can do\nthat, it's explained later on.\n\nThe same command is used both for building the first time, and rebuilding: aliBuild is smart and\nit will rebuild only what changed.\n Why is aliBuild rebuilding everything?!?!? 😠🤬One or more of the following actions might change the way aliBuild sees and uses the dependencies\nand might result in a full (or nearly full) rebuild. So, if an important conference is\napproaching, plan the following actions accordingly as they might increase the build time:\n\nUpdating recipes in alidist\nRemoving the cache $ALIBUILD_WORK_DIR or forgetting to export the variable\nAdding or removing system dependencies as seen by aliDoctor\nUpdating your operating system or compilers (including Xcode on macOS)\n\n\nIf you need to build Run 3 software, simply do:\naliBuild build O2 --defaults o2\n\non every platform.\naliBuild installation will finish with a clear indication of what to do to use the software you\nhave just built. This part is covered in the next section.\n Build takes up too many laptop resources!Building ALICE software is a resource-expensive operation. By default, aliBuild uses as many laptop\nresources as possible for building. If you need to work while building, you can use the -j flag to\ntell aliBuild to use fewer CPUs (just one in the example below):\naliBuild build O2 -j 1 --defaults o2\n\n\nUse the software you have built\naliBuild comes with a tool called alienv: this tool is used to load the correct environment for\nthe software you have built. Notably, alienv can manage multiple versions of the same software\nwithout conflicts.\nJust open a terminal and type:\nalienv q\n\nto display the list of available packages. To load the latest version you have built of AliPhysics,\ndo:\nalienv enter AliPhysics/latest\n\n\nNote that this command will load AliPhysics and all its dependencies automatically, so there\nis absolutely no need to also load, e.g., AliRoot or ROOT!\n\nThe enter command drops you to a new shell, meaning that you can \"clean up\" your environment by\nsimply exiting it.\n\nPlease also note that aliBuild will tell you exactly what you need to type in order to load the\nsoftware you have just built. Just use aliBuild's suggestion in place of AliPhysics/latest\nwherever appropriate.\n\nIf you know what you are doing, you can also load the environment in your current shell:\nalienv load AliPhysics/latest\n\nIn this case, you will clear the environment by doing:\nalienv unload AliPhysics/latest\n\nIf you want to load the environment inside a script you are developing, just add this line:\nsource $(alienv printenv AliPhysics/latest)\n\n Do not load alienv automatically!Even if this is technically possible, it is strongly not recommended to load the environment with\nalienv in your ~/.bashrc! You must keep your environment pristine for safely running\naliBuild. By not loading the environment automatically, you will avoid a huge source of errors.\nDo you still find annoying to type alienv enter AliPhysics/latest every time you want to use it?\nYou can add the following line in your ~/.bashrc to make it more convenient:\nalias ali='alienv enter AliPhysics/latest'\n\nYou are creating an alias called ali, that will load the environment by just typing it at the\nprompt. Of course you can use any name you want.\n\nBuild and use the same source with different options\naliBuild and alienv give you the ability to build the same development source with different\ndefaults without duplicating the source, and without conflicts.\nImagine we are under ~/alice and we have cloned AliRoot and AliPhysics with the aliBuild init\ncommand above. We build AliPhysics twice, once with ROOT 5 and a second time against ROOT 6.\n ROOT package in development modeBear in mind that in this example we are assuming you don't have ROOT in development mode, i.e.\nyou have only cloned AliRoot and AliPhysics in your current directory (with aliBuild init), not\nROOT!\nIf you did that, then you need to manually enter the ROOT directory and checkout the proper ROOT\nversion by yourself.\n\nHere's the ROOT 5 build command (note the -z aliroot5 suffix, giving our build a special name\nthat allows to distinguish it from the ROOT 6 one):\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults user -z aliroot5\n\nThe command ends with a message saying what to do to use the package:\nalienv enter AliPhysics/latest-aliroot5-user\n\nNotice that aliBuild tells you what is the exact alienv command to run to use this build. Let's\ndo the same with ROOT 6 (note that we use a distinct name, -z aliroot6):\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults user-root6 -z aliroot6\n\nNow, the message tells us to type:\nalienv enter AliPhysics/latest-aliroot6-user-root6\n\nto use the package. As you can see, aliroot6 is part of the package name.\nKeep in mind that:\n\naliBuild always tells you what is the package name to load at the end of the build\nyou can load the two environments separately, in two different shells, with no chance of a mixup\nyou have used the same set of sources for generating two distinct builds\nalienv enter AliPhysics/latest will load the latest you have built, which can either be the\nROOT 5 or ROOT 6-based version: given its ambiguity, do use explicit names instead\n\nIt is also possible to directly run aliroot (or any command you want) without \"entering\" the\nenvironment:\nalienv setenv AliPhysics/latest-aliroot5-user -c aliroot\nalienv setenv AliPhysics/latest-aliroot6-user-root6 -c aliroot\n\nThe aliroot command will be run with the correct environment in both cases.\n Migrating from ROOT 5 to ROOT 6While you are at it, if you want to migrate your existing code to ROOT 6 (and make sure it works\nthere) check out our migration guide.\n\nBuild specific releases (tags) of the software\nIt might come useful to build a certain tag of AliRoot and AliPhysics instead of simply pulling the\nmaster.\n\nNote that we only guarantee that the current AliPhysics master works against the latest AliRoot\ntag! It is therefore possible (though a rare occurrence) that the current AliRoot master breaks\nthe current AliPhysics master.\n\nIf you have your source code in \"development mode\" (i.e. downloaded locally by means of aliBuild\ninit), since your AliRoot/AliPhysics/O2 directories are mere Git\nrepositories, you simply need to cd into them and\ncheckout the Git version you want.\nFor instance, if you want to build AliPhysics against AliRoot v5-09-33, you would need to first\nmove to the AliRoot directory and check the version out:\ncd ~/alice/AliRoot\ngit fetch origin --tags\ngit checkout v5-09-33\n\nThen update your AliPhysics master:\ncd ~/alice/AliPhysics\ngit fetch origin master\ngit checkout master\ngit reset --hard origin/master\n\nand then build normally using the aliBuild command. You might want to build using different -z\noptions as explained here in order to have\ndifferent builds usable in parallel without duplicating your source code.\nRunning in Docker\nDocker is a popular way to run Linux containers. As a consequence you\nwill get the runtime environment of a different operating system without the overhead of a virtual\nmachine.\nThis may be useful if your OS is unsupported, or if you want to have a fully isolated environment\nfor your ALICE builds: you simply create a container corresponding to one of the supported Linux\nOSes and follow the corresponding prerequisites. The examples below focus on the CentOS 7\ncontainer as this is the reference environment for ALICE.\nThis is how to install Docker on:\n\nUbuntu\nCentOS\nmacOS\nWindows\n\nIf you are a macOS user, you should tune your memory settings once for all by clicking on the Docker\nwhale icon in the taskbar, then Preferences... → Advanced. Set the CPUs to the maximum\navailable, and the memory to at least 4 GB (the more the merrier). Click Apply & Restart.\nCreate a persistent container by giving it a friendly name (we have chosen aliceBuildEnvironment):\ndocker run -it --name aliceBuildEnvironment -v $HOME/alice:$HOME/alice:rw centos:7\n\nThe -v ... switch tells Docker to make your system's directory ~/alice visible under the exact\nsame path in your container. This allows Docker to save your work environment on your system, not\ninside the container: your container is therefore disposable, even if you lose it you won't lose\nyour ALICE builds.\n Use the same directory pathIt is quite important that you use the exact same directory name inside the container: this is\nthe only way to make aliBuild work on the same directory both inside the container and outside. This\nallows you to share, for instance, the Git clones across installations on different platforms, and\nsave you gigabytes of space!\nPlease also note that the value of the variable $HOME inside the container will be different, so\nbefore entering the container just display its value:\necho $HOME\n\nand then inside the container cd into that path.\n\nA root shell will open inside the container. It will be the same as using a CentOS 7 operating\nsystem (in case you've used the centos:7 container)\nuntil you type exit: this means you will have to follow the proper installation\nprerequisites as usual.\nWhen you are done with the prerequisites you can continue your installation as\nusual inside the container.\nStart your saved container\nSince your container is persistently saved, you can always restart it if you exit it or reboot your\ncomputer with:\ndocker start aliceBuildEnvironment\n\nThe command will return immediately (and will do nothing if the container is already running). Once\nstarted (check with docker ps) you can connect to it as many times as you want with:\ndocker exec -it aliceBuildEnvironment bash\n\nRemove your container\nIn case your container environment gets messed up for some reason, you can erase it completely with:\ndocker rm -f aliceBuildEnvironment\n\nThis will terminate any active session if running. Since your ~/alice directory contains all the\naliBuild installation artifacts, if you intend to perform an aliBuild cleanup you should remove that\ndirectory too.\n"},"building/prereq-macos.html":{"url":"building/prereq-macos.html","title":"aliBuild prerequisites for macOS","keywords":"","body":"aliBuild prerequisites for macOS\nALICE software compiles just fine on macOS using Apple-provided build tools. We support exclusively\nthe following two versions of macOS:\n\nHigh Sierra (10.13)\nMojave (10.14)\n\nAny other version of macOS has to be considered not supported. If you are in doubt about\nupgrading your operating system and you still don't see the new version here, then please refrain\nfrom upgrading.\nPlease follow these instructions every time you install a new macOS version and every time you get\na newer Xcode! This is non-optional!\n Upgrade your macOS/Xcode with careThe instructions you see on this page have been validated on October 1, 2018 using:\n\nmacOS 10.14\nXcode 10.0 (10A255)\n\nEven minor version updates on macOS/Xcode may break our build chain, and it might take us days\nbefore fixing it. Keep an eye on this page to see if we have tested the latest versions first.\n\nGet or upgrade Xcode\nXcode is the Apple-provided toolkit for developing software on Apple devices. Xcode is required as\nit contains the necessary compilers and build tools used by ALICE.\nGet it from the App Store by clicking here:\nif the link does not work, just open the App Store and search for Xcode. The installation is free of\ncharge, but it takes quite some space on your Mac.\nWhen installed, open it: if it asks you to install additional required components, please approve\nthe action.\nInstallation's not over yet. Additional components (the \"command-line tools\") are required. Open a\nterminal and run:\nxcode-select --install\n\nIn case they are already installed, you'll see the following message:\nxcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use \"Software Update\" to install updates\nThis is important: once Xcode and the command-line tools are installed, every update will occur\ngraphically via the App Store.\nNow, at your first installation, you need to accept the Xcode license. If the above command did not\nask you anything, just open a terminal and write:\ngit\n\nwithout any further option. You will be prompted in case there is a license to accept. In case the\nlicense has been accepted already, you'll just see the list of options for the git command.\nGet or upgrade Homebrew\nHomebrew is a command-line package manager for macOS. It is the most popular now,\nand it is the only one we support.\n\nIf you have other package managers installed, such as MacPorts or Fink, you must get rid of them\nbefore proceeding. They will conflict with Homebrew and ALICE software in a bad way.\n\nNote that Homebrew does not run as root. Do not prepend sudo to any of the following commands!\nInstallation instructions are ridiculously simple on the website. Once Homebrew\nis installed, run (as suggested):\nbrew doctor\n\nand fix any potential error highlighted by the tool. Errors and warnings should not be\noverlooked! Pay close attention to warnings concerning outdated Xcode/compiler versions: you must upgrade Xcode to the latest available version before proceeding any further!\n Clean up your Homebrew installationDue to a problem with the automake 1.16 package,\nsubsequently fixed in version 1.16.1, a Homebrew workaround has been suggested on this page.\nIf you have applied the suggested workaround, the brew doctor command from above complains with\nthe following message:\nWarning: Homebrew/homebrew-core is not on the master branch\n\nCheck out the master branch by running:\n  git -C \"$(brew --repo homebrew/core)\" checkout master\nTo clean it up, it is better if you run the following commands (and not just the one suggested by\nbrew doctor):\ncd \"$(brew --repo homebrew/core)\"\ngit checkout master\ngit fetch origin master\ngit reset --hard origin/master\n\n\nWhen you are done fixing the warnings, upgrade all the currently installed Homebrew packages:\nbrew upgrade\n\nIt is now time to install a bunch of required packages. Copy and paste this to your terminal\n(warning: long line):\nbrew install autoconf automake boost coreutils gettext gmp hub isl libmpc libtool m4 modules mpfr openssl pkg-config readline modules xz libpng perl\n\nIf you have just upgraded your Xcode or macOS, you should run brew reinstall instead, in order to\nforce the reinstallation of already installed packages. You also might want to run brew cleanup at\nthe end to free up some space.\nNow, open your ~/.bash_profile (you should have a default one; create one if it does not exist,\nand bear in mind that ~ represents your home directory) and add the following content:\nexport PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\"\n\nThe line above tells your shell (assuming it's Bash) where to find Homebrew programs. To check if it\nworks, close the terminal, open a new one, and type:\ntype autopoint\n\nYou should get as an answer:\nautopoint is /usr/local/opt/gettext/bin/autopoint\nGet or upgrade gfortran\nYour Xcode installation is missing a Fortran compiler, unfortunately. We need it for some parts of\nour code, therefore you must install it.\nThe GCC project has a downloads page for macOS: get the version that corresponds to your operating\nsystem the most. This means that if gfortran for your operating system version is not out yet, you\ncan safely download the one for the previous version.\nDownloads are dmg files: just double-click on them with Finder and follow the graphical installation\nprocedure.\nWhen done, open a terminal and check if you can find it:\ntype gfortran\n\nYou should obtain:\ngfortran is /usr/local/bin/gfortran\nDisable System Integrity Protection\nStarting from El Capitan (10.11), Apple has introduced a security feature called System Integrity\nProtection, or SIP.\nAt the moment, unfortunately, ALICE software requires this feature to be turned off.\nTo turn SIP off:\n\nReboot your Mac in Recovery Mode. That is, before macOS starts up, hold down Command-R and\nkeep both keys pressed until the Apple logo appears.\nFrom the Utilities menu open a Terminal.\nType: csrutil disable: a message will notify the success of your operation.\nSelect Restart from the  menu.\n\nNote: you can always re-enable it using csrutil enable instead.\nGet or upgrade pip\npip is the Python package manager. Our build tool\naliBuild and other Python dependencies are installed\nthrough it.\nIn case you are using Python from Anaconda or Python from Homebrew\nthen you have pip already. Check it by typing:\ntype pip\n\nat your shell prompt. In case you don't use Anaconda, please install pip with this command:\nsudo easy_install pip\n\nNote that you need admin permissions for running the above command. Once done, check that pip got\ninstalled under /usr/local/bin:\ntype pip\n\nIt should yield:\npip is /usr/local/bin/pip\nNote that the Python version installed by means of easy_install might be too old. Check it with:\npip --version\n\nYou must have at least pip 9.0.1. If this is not the case, please run:\npip install --upgrade pip==9.0.1\n\nGet or upgrade required Python packages\nSome Python packages are required for building our software. They are mostly related to ROOT 6. Just\nrun:\nsudo pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall matplotlib numpy certifi ipython==5.1.0 ipywidgets ipykernel notebook metakernel pyyaml\n\n\nIt is important to specify ipython's version explicitly.\n\nExclude your work directory from Spotlight\nMac users have two nice features, Time Machine for backups and Spotlight for searches, that might\nhave a detrimental effect on your Mac's performances.\nSpotlight, in particular, indexes every created file, and since during our build and installation\nprocesses we create a lot of files we don't really want to index, it's better to tell Spotlight\nnot to index our working directory.\nWe are assuming our working directory is ~/alice. Before telling Spotlight to exclude it, we need\nto create an empty one, so in a Terminal do:\nmkdir ~/alice\n\n(you can also use the Finder for that.) Then, go to the  (Apple) menu → System preferences →\nSpotlight. Click on the Privacy tab, then hit the + sign at the bottom of the window. Now\nselect the ~/alice directory and confirm.\nYou are now ready for installing aliBuild and start building ALICE\nsoftware\n"},"building/prereq-ubuntu.html":{"url":"building/prereq-ubuntu.html","title":"aliBuild prerequisites for Ubuntu","keywords":"","body":"aliBuild prerequisites for Ubuntu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt ALICE we do our best to support two versions of Ubuntu: the latest and greatest, and the latest\nLTS (Long Term Support) release.
